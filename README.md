Learn how to build a machine learning regression model without writing a single line of code using the designer.

This pipeline trains a linear regressor to predict a car's price based on technical features such as make, model, horsepower, and size. Because you're trying to answer the question "How much?" this is called a regression problem. However, you can apply the same fundamental steps in this example to tackle any type of machine learning problem whether it be regression, classification, clustering, and so on.

The fundamental steps of a training machine learning model are:

1) Get the data
2) Pre-process the data
3) Train the model
4) Evaluate the model
